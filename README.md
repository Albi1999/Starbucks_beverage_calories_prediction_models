## Overview
We have analyzed the Starbucks Beverage Components dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be found at the following link: [Starbucks Beverage Components Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/starbucks).
Our goal was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data and build models for accurate predictions

## Tools Used
We used R for all the analysis and Rmarkdown to write the report.
